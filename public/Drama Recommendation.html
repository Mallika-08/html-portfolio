<h2><b>My Recommendations</b></h2><hr />
<h3>Falling Into Your Smile</h3>
<p>
This is one of my favourite C-Dramas...The way they show the love and passion towards the work they do and people near to them.
</p>
<h3>Gen-Z</h3>
<p>
In this they show the importance of the TCM and the emotions that ae bounded to the person.
</p>
<h3>Hidden Love</h3>
<p>
It is all about love between the high school girl and the boy pursuing his post graduation. 
</p>
<h3>Princess and the Werewolf</h3>
<p>
The love between princess of the other country and the king of beast clan and the difficulties they go through in order to save people of the beast clan.
